**Steganography**

Steganography is the process of hiding text data inside images, audio, video.

There are several algorithms for achieving steganography.

In this project I have implemented LST(Least Significant Bit) algorithm on Steganography.

Features

1. **Encoding**: Users need to enter an image path and text to be encoded.
    
    **Result**: Image with text hidden inside image.
  
2. **Decoding**: Users need to enter an image path.
    
    **Result**: Text decoded from image.
